# Case Study/Data Analysis & Findings

## Case Study 1: Azure Cloud Services Implementation

During the visit, we were introduced to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and its implementation for various enterprise clients in India. The case study focused on how Microsoft helped a major Indian financial institution migrate its legacy systems to the Azure cloud.

### Challenge
The financial institution was operating on outdated infrastructure that was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain and was limiting their ability to scale and innovate.

### Solution
Microsoft's team at the Noida office designed a phased migration approach that included:

1. Assessment of existing systems and data
2. Development of a hybrid cloud architecture
3. Implementation of Azure security features to ensure compliance with financial regulations
4. Training programs for the client's IT staff

### Results

| Metric | Before Migration | After Migration |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| System Downtime | 99.5% uptime | 99.99% uptime |
| Disaster Recovery Time | 24-48 hours | <2 hours |
| Infrastructure Costs | ₹100 million/year | ₹65 million/year |
| New Service Deployment | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |

The migration resulted in a 35% reduction in infrastructure costs while significantly improving system reliability and agility.

## Case Study 2: AI-Powered Healthcare Solutions

Another significant project showcased during the visit was the development of AI-powered healthcare solutions by Microsoft's Healthcare vertical at the Noida office.

### Challenge
A network of hospitals in India was struggling with efficient diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to blindness if not detected early. The shortage of specialized ophthalmologists was causing delays in diagnosis and treatment.

### Solution
Microsoft's team developed an AI model trained on thousands of retinal images to detect signs of diabetic retinopathy. The solution included:

1. A machine learning algorithm for image analysis
2. Integration with existing hospital management systems
3. A user-friendly interface for healthcare workers
4. Cloud-based processing for accessibility from remote locations

### Results

The AI solution achieved:
- 91% accuracy in detecting diabetic retinopathy
- Reduction in diagnosis time from days to minutes
- Ability to screen 1,000+ patients daily
- Deployment across 15 hospitals serving rural communities
